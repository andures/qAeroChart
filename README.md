## PR documentation policy

PR documentation files under `docs/` are only required when both conditions apply:

- The PR fixes a user-requested/assigned issue (for example: “Vertical Scale is not 10× exaggerated #7”), or the maintainer explicitly requests documentation; and
- The change benefits from a short test plan and acceptance criteria for reviewers.

When required, use these naming conventions:

- English: `docs/PR-issue-<number>-en.md`
- Spanish: `docs/PR-issue-<number>-es.md` (add if bilingual docs are requested)

Each PR doc should include: Summary, Changes, How to Test, Acceptance Criteria, Risks, Documentation Updates, and Screenshots (if applicable).

Templates are available:

- `docs/PR-template-en.md`
- `docs/PR-template-es.md`
